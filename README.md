# Project Summary

This project's architecture is primarily based on **Zenject** as the Dependency Injection (DI) container. The entry point of the application is a **bootstrap scene**. The logic is not confined to MonoBehaviour components alone, as a bunch of services were used to manage the functionality across the application. 

For asset management, I opted to use the **Resources** folder, given the scope of this test task. If the project were larger, I would have implemented **Addressables** for better asset loading management.

# Task Conditions

All tasks specified in the technical requirements were completed, as well as to the principles outlined in the guidelines.
